Just a list of TODOs so I don't lose track.

- Apparently this can't be converted with 2to3
    I am going to need to read up on how to work around this one...

    RefactoringTool: Files that need to be modified:
    RefactoringTool: obd_io.py
    RefactoringTool: Warnings/messages while refactoring:
    RefactoringTool: ### In file obd_io.py ###
    RefactoringTool: Line 157: could not convert: raise "BogusCode"
    RefactoringTool: Python 3 does not support string exceptions

- After converting pyobd to python3 I now get this error.

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "./pyobd", line 28, in <module>
          import wx
          ImportError: No module named 'wx

    I suspect this one will be quite simple, but it's been awhile
    since I last seriously fucked with python...
