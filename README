pyobd
=====

This is my fork of the pyobd project from http://www.obdtester.com/pyobd-download

I am an absolute novice when it comes to python (or anything outside of bash really).
Being a n00b I figured setting up a git repo for revision control might be a good idea.

Hopefully, in the future I'll feel this code is worthy of sharing and possibly
get it upstream (although with my talents this goal may be very, very, far off).

The personal end goal of this project is to provide a small dash mounted display which
I can mount inside of my pickup and give me some additional "meters" outputed in a
colorful ncurses based display (similar to htop). Possibly by means of a Raspberry Pi.
